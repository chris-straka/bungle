# Bungle 

It's a backend for 

## Auth

- Sign-in route + OAuth
- Save/forgot password
- Demo User

## Home Screen

- User's should be able to put where they are on a map
- Other Bungler's could show up on the map
- User is shown the weather and time depending on where they chose on the map
- General news should be shown below the map
- Spotify, weather, time and something else should be shown on the right
- Wikipedia option maybe? Depending on what their API says
- I think making it look like the spring docs with a menu on the left, map in the middle, articles below,

## Bungle Mode

- Users insert their own text blurb or receive a random article from wikipedia or the news API
- The backend will store a list of familiar words the user already understands
- The user can "bungle" an article
- The user can turn on pinyin for that data

## CI with github actions and vclusters
